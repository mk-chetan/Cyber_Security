#### HTTP and DNS:

-  **HTTP Common Methods**:

	- GET - fetch the resource
	- POST - Submit to form
	- PUT - Update a resource
	- DELETE - Remove a resource
	
- **HTTP Response Codes:**

	- 1xx - Informational
	- 2xx - Successful
	- 3xx - Redirection
	- 4xx - Client errors
	- 5xx - Server errors
	
- HTTP requests are stateless, so each request sent or received from the server are treated as a new request, so the Cookies are used to maintain the state between multiple HTTP requests coming from 1 user.

- **DNS ( Domain Naming System ):**

	- Convert domain names into IP-address
		- Top level domain:
			- .com, .in, .org etc.
		- Second level domain:
			- google, tcm-sec and etc.
		- Sub domain:
			- www, academy.tcm-sec, etc.
